            <p>
                After having launched Mangalyaan successfully in the orbit of Mars, Indian Scientists
                now dream about newer inventions and discoveries with great ingenious ideas and
                brains, I believe that we have great future for our nation. With this strong belief,
                we at MREC have initiated a number of programs for the faculty and the students
                to get upgraded and updated with the technology so that we may work on par with
                the global standards. While involving students in greater academic persuits, we
                also encourage them to work in the areas of green technologies, innovations, social
                entrepreneurship and areas that make them all rounders. With these ideas, we believe
                in bringing out graduates who would be global citizens with human touch working
                towards a technologically advanced nation.
